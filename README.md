# Wordle Variants

Welcome to a list of Wordle variants. I personally enjoy playing the different
types of games and even aspire to make one of my own. As of now, however, I
often forget which ones I've played. As a result, I thought I'd put together
a nice list, which you can freely contribute to. 

- [Wordle][wordle]: guess a 5-letter word in 6 guesses
- [Semantle][semantle]: guess a word based on its semantics
